# ExploratoryDataAnalysis_on-IrisDataset

EDA is the process of investigating the dataset to discover patterns, and anomalies (outliers), and form hypotheses based on our understanding of the dataset.

EDA involves generating summary statistics for numerical data in the dataset and creating various graphical representations to understand the data better. 
In this analysis we are using Python and few of its data visualisation libraries like Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn and a few other data structures.

Since EDA is majorly performed to get insights on data, we will try to get the information about the skewness, and the correlation of data and the statistical insights
